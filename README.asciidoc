Objectives
----------

When you have completed this homework, you should be able to:

* Write facts into a Prolog database and be able to perform queries against them
* Understand how to use variables to unify against facts
* Be able to write recursive rules


Getting started with Prolog
---------------------------

In order to complete this assignment, you will need to learn how to set up and
use Prolog.  While you can use any implementation of Prolog you wish, I suggest
you use SWI-Prolog as this will be implementation of Prolog I will be supporting.

To learn how to install and use SWI-Prolog, please refer to the
link:doc/getting-started-with-prolog.asciidoc[Getting started with Prolog]
document.
